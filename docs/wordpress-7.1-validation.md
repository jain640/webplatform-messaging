# WordPress 7.1 compatibility validation

WordPress.org requested plugin authors to validate compatibility with WordPress 7.1 before changing the `Tested up to` value in `readme.txt`.

## Test matrix

Run the checks on the latest WordPress 7.1 release candidate (and repeat on the final 7.1 release):

- PHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.2, and 8.3 where available.
- WordPress 7.1 with the default theme.
- WordPress 7.1 with WooCommerce enabled.

## Required checks

1. Install and activate WebPlatform Messaging Connector on a clean WordPress site.
2. Confirm Settings > WebPlatform WhatsApp loads without PHP warnings, notices, or JavaScript errors.
3. Save the WebPlatform URL and merchant API token and reload the settings page.
4. Run the connection test and retrieve approved templates.
5. Send a permitted manual test message during an open customer-service window.
6. With WooCommerce enabled, confirm the checkout opt-in is present and unchecked by default.
7. Trigger processing, completed, and cancelled order notifications using approved templates.
8. Confirm successful and failed submissions create the expected order notes without exposing credentials.
9. Run WordPress-user synchronization.
10. With WooCommerce enabled, run order synchronization.
11. Verify the Messaging Campaigns dashboard link opens the expected WebPlatform destination.
12. Run WordPress Plugin Check and resolve new errors before release.
13. Review the PHP error log and browser console after the smoke tests.

## Release gate

Only after the checks above pass:

1. Change `Tested up to: 7.0` to `Tested up to: 7.1` in `readme.txt`.
2. Do not change `Stable tag` or the plugin version for a metadata-only compatibility declaration unless code also changes.
3. Commit the readme update to the WordPress.org SVN `trunk` and the current stable tag as appropriate for the release workflow.
4. Verify the WordPress.org plugin page shows WordPress 7.1 compatibility.
